# VLC Scheduler
This project is made using mainly Python for VLC as a solution for an automatic film scheduling problem. It is focused mainly for cinemas, but can be used anywhere. The idea is derived from implementation of the same problem in cinema servers (as Dolby or Christie). However instead of using _Digital Cinema Packages_ (_DCP_ s), VLC uses _.mp4_, _.mkv_ and similar filetypes.

## Implementation
This program uses HTTP requests for communication with VLC http interface. All available requests can be found [here](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_HTTP_requests/).

## Deploy
For deploying you must have installed VLC. In VLC it's needed to enable "_Web_ interface" in the following way:  
In upper bar press "_Tools_" -> "_Settings_", the window will pop-up. At the bottom of the window press "_All_" (settings) -> "_Interface_" -> "_Main interfaces_" and enable "_Web_". Then restart VLC.        
   
   
_**WILL BE COMPLETED**_
